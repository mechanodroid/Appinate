# Appinate
Notes for install:

To install, you should click on either of the following filename which you should see in the root of the Appinate folder on github (I'd recommend clicking on the first one listed below, the other one is a debug version)
   com.uwmiui.appinate.apk
   com.debug.thawedcodebase.appinate.apk

Once you click on this file it will take you to the file view, where you can then click on "raw", which will prompt you
to save the file to your android device.  Once you have done so, open your downloads folder on the android device and click it, select install.   Note: you may have to go to Settings on your android device to allow for installing applications
from unknown sources.

Notes for usage:
 
To use Phase 1:
Don’t click any check boxes and simply put in your search
 
To use Phase 2:
First use phase 1 to create a “like list”.  On the results screen click anything you like and hit save.  If you ever want to edit this list you can hit edit list.  For phase 2, like phase 3- you don’t have to give a search term, you can if you want but if you don’t it only uses Nrake and your likes list.
 
To use Phase 3:
Right now I entered in some basic “likes” on the cloud.  I did so using the following:
Whatever gamer type you have selected on the first screen, when you hit save likes in the likes list it will save that as a like entry to the cloud.  So if you want to populate this, select the gamer type either on the main screen or on edit likes and then hit save.
 
You have to select a gamer type in order to use phase 3.  Then you check the second box and you can optionally ALSO provide a search term up top.
