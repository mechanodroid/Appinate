# Appinate
Notes for usage:
 
To use Phase 1:
Don’t click any check boxes and simply put in your search
 
To use Phase 2:
First use phase 1 to create a “like list”.  On the results screen click anything you like and hit save.  If you ever want to edit this list you can hit edit list.  For phase 2, like phase 3- you don’t have to give a search term, you can if you want but if you don’t it only uses Nrake and your likes list.
 
To use Phase 3:
Right now I entered in some basic “likes” on the cloud.  I did so using the following:
Whatever gamer type you have selected on the first screen, when you hit save likes in the likes list it will save that as a like entry to the cloud.  So if you want to populate this, select the gamer type either on the main screen or on edit likes and then hit save.
 
You have to select a gamer type in order to use phase 3.  Then you check the second box and you can optionally ALSO provide a search term up top.
